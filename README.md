# MLE Job Interview Assistant

## Welcome! 
Welcome to your personal Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) interview simulation. This project utilizes generative AI to simulate realistic MLE interviews, based on the job descriptions you provide. 

As a machine learning engineer, you have to continuously evolve your skills and knowledge in order to to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving field. I wanted to build a tool that enabled myself and others to practice machine learning interviews that are realistic, challenging, and specific to the roles/companies being applied to.
